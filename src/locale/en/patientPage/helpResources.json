            "answer": "To request a prescription refill, go to your Medications dashboard and find the medication you need refilled. Click the 'Request Refill' button. You'll be asked to confirm your pharmacy preference and any additional notes for your doctor. Once submitted, your request will be sent to your healthcare provider for approval. You can track the status of your refill request in the 'Recent Activity' section on your dashboard.",

            "question": "What should I do if I missed a dose of my medication?",
            "answer": "If you miss a dose of your medication, what you should do depends on the specific medication and how late you are in taking it. As a general rule: 1) If it's within a few hours of your normal time, take the dose as soon as you remember. 2) If it's close to your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. 3) Never take a double dose to make up for a missed one unless specifically directed by your healthcare provider. For specific guidance, check the medication instructions in your prescription details or contact your healthcare provider.",

            "question": "What do I do if my prescription has expired?",
            "answer": "If your prescription has expired, you'll need to request a renewal from your doctor rather than a refill. In the Prescriptions section, expired medications will be clearly marked. Select the expired medication and click 'Request Renewal' instead of 'Request Refill'. This will initiate a request to your healthcare provider to evaluate and potentially issue a new prescription. You may need to schedule an appointment or consultation before a renewal is approved, depending on the medication and your doctor's policies.",

Click on 'Add New Pharmacy' and you can search for pharmacies by name, address, or zip code. Once you find your preferred pharmacy, select it and click 'Add to My Pharmacies'.
